## Project directory strcutures

The structure of a directory for a project may vary. Here I suggest the following components:

1. README file
2. data directory
3. raw data directory
4. analysis directory
5. figures directory
6. pipline_scirpts directory

For example, I am about to start working on a project investigating microbial metabolism of food components. For this project I've created a github linked repository called 'P6_MicrobesEat'.

mkdir P6_MicrobesEat

I added a brief description of the project in the readme file.

touch README.md


And, I've created my suggested sub-directories.

mkdir data/ raw_data analysis figures pipeline_scripts

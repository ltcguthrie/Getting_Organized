## Creating Pull Requests

We will focus on creating a pull request for a repository that you do not have write access to. If you are a collaborator on a personal
repository owned by someone else you will have write access.

First, create a copy or fork of the repository using the github UI.

You have made some changes to your copy.  To create a pull request push changes to your fork.

`git push origin <branchname>`

1. Go to your fork on Github. You should now see  and click on a green button called "Compare & pull request".

2. Describe your pull request.

3. Wait for approval.
